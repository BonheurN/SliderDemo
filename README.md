# Slider Demo - Java Swing GUI

This repository contains a Java Swing application called `SliderDemo` that demonstrates how to create a simple graphical user interface (GUI) with a vertical slider, using Java's Swing library. The slider allows users to adjust a value between 0 and 100, with the current value displayed in a label.

## Features

- Vertical slider ranging from 0 to 100, initialized to 30.
- Displays the current slider value in Celsius (Â°C) beside the slider.
- Slider supports:
  - **Tick marks** for better usability.
  - **Minor ticks** spaced at intervals of 10 units.
  - **Major ticks** spaced at intervals of 25 units.
  - Display of value labels beside the ticks.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.
- Any Java IDE (e.g., Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, NetBeans) or text editor.

Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
Compile and run the SliderDemo.java file.
The application window will open, displaying the slider and label. Moving the slider will update the label with the current value.
